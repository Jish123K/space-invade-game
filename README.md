Description: The player takes on the role of a lone spaceship pilot defending Earth from an alien invasion. The aliens come in waves and the player must shoot them down before they reach the planet's surface. The game takes place in space and features 2D graphics.

Gameplay: The player uses arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right, and the spacebar to shoot. The aliens come in different shapes and sizes and move in different patterns. Some aliens take multiple hits to destroy, and some drop power-ups that the player can collect to upgrade their weapons or shields.

As the player progresses through the game, the waves of aliens become more difficult to defeat. Eventually, the player will face a boss battle against a massive alien spaceship. The game features multiple levels and high scores are recorded to encourage replayability.

Technical Details: The game will use the Pygame library for graphics and input handling. Sprites will be used to represent the player, aliens, and power-ups. Collision detection will be used to determine when an alien or power-up has been hit by the player's bullets. Sound effects and music will also be included to enhance the gameplay experience.

Overall, "Space Invaders: The Last Stand" is a classic arcade-style game with modern graphics and features.
